## Project Description
For my final project I would like to create an official website for Kosovo. I am planning on building out a homepage, "About Kosovo", "Things to do" and "Plan your trip." I will also incorporate a login where users can write a review under the things to do component.

## Wireframes
Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe.

## Priority Matrix
Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the Time and Importance Matix.

#### MVP

## UI Components
Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components.

#### SAMPLE.....
Component	Description
Header	This will render the header include the nav
Footer	This will render the header include the nav
Time frames are also key in the development cycle. You have limited time to code all phases of the game. Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

#### SAMPLE.....
Component	Priority	Estimated Time	Actual Time
Setting up login/auth	H	6hrs	hrs
Setting up relationship/database	H	5hrs	hrs
Using react native to set up components H 5hrs hrs
Total	H	11hrs	hrs

Helper Functions
Helper functions should be generic enought that they can be reused in other applications. Use this section to document all helper functions that fall into this category.

Additional Libraries
Use this section to list all supporting libraries and thier role in the project.

#### SAMPLE.....
Library	What it Does
Bootstrap	Used to help style my application
Giphy API	Used to get gifs to use
Code Snippet
Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description

#### SAMPLE.....
function reverse(string) {
	// here is the code to reverse a string of text
}
Change Log
Use this section to document what changes were made and the reasoning behind those changes.
