UI Components
Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components.

SAMPLE.....
Component	Description
Header	This will render the header include the nav
Footer	This will render the header include the nav
Time frames are also key in the development cycle. You have limited time to code all phases of the game. Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

SAMPLE.....
Component	Priority	Estimated Time	Actual Time
Setting up login/auth	H	6hrs	hrs
Setting up relationship/database	H	5hrs	hrs
Using react native to set up components H 5hrs hrs
Total	H	11hrs	hrs

Helper Functions

Code Snippet
Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description
