The waters of Peć Bistrica river have cut their way through the mountains in a breathtaking way. Rugova Canyon offers great opportunities for hikers, rock-climbers and cave explorers. A 'Via Ferrata', called the 'Iron Trail', has been built. It is the first and the only one in the Balkans and enables hikers to climb rocks."},
